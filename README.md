# The Aspen Walker's Software Journal

A local journal discussing the craft of building and using software.

## Contributing

To contribute an article, you can fork this repository, make a feature branch, and then make a PR.
This PR should only contain a single markdown file or a folder containing your article's content.
These files should be contained in `./the-cutting-room/`.

All articles should be relevant to the work and interests of software engineers and computer programmers.
I reserve the right to reject an article or request changes on any grounds.

Your contribution should either be a single markdown or typst file, or it could be a folder containing a markdown/typst file and any supporting content (e.g. images).
The file name of your markdown/typst file or your folder should approximately match the article's intended title.
If you have a very specific title/subtitle for your article, you should note that in your PR and/or your markdown file.

If your article is timely (meaning it is intended for a specific edition of the journal) specify that in your PR.
Otherwise, I will assume it can work in any edition and I may push it off until a future edition.

Make an issue or contact me with any additional questions you may have.
