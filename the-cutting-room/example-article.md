This is the body of the example article.
I generally like to end each sentence with a newline for maximum readability in my editor, but it doesn't matter too much.
This example is in markdown because more people are familiar with it.
If you would rather writing your article directly using the [Typst](https://typst.app/) format, you are welcome to do so.
I am fine with either.
It may be a little more work for me to convert your markdown into Typst, but also I would likely have to change any Typst code you write to make it work in the journal format, so I am flexible.

I will update this example article if I think of any other advice.
